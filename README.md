## Hello World 👋
I'm a German student and since I'm really into programming I spend a lot of time working on my projects.
So far **I learned C, Java, Flutter and a little bit about the way Linux and Android work**. These are my repositories and organisations:

- **[GymTrim](https://github.com/naibaf-1/GymTrim):** *A nice gym application for Android*
- **[GNOME-Wallpaper-Collection](https://github.com/naibaf-1/GNOME-Wallpaper-Collection):** *A collection of nice wallpapers*
- **[CodeJudgeOrg](https://github.com/CodeJudgeOrg):** *My organisation behind a simple code judge using C and Flutter, which simulates exams*

I want to collaborate on some nice projects, because **I want to show and improve my skills**. At the moment I'm also diving into some nice AI stuff, by **contributing to the [GluckBot](https://github.com/Willibald-Gluck-Gymnasium/gluck-bot)** of the [Willibald Gluck Gymnasium](https://github.com/Willibald-Gluck-Gymnasium).
However: I'm still working on my projects listed above, so if you want to help me, **feel free to contribute** some nice wallpapers to my collection or contribute to GymTrim or CodeJudge. I'm glad if people report issues or if they even contribute, because it shows that my projects are actually useful.
