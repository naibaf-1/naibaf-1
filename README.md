## Hello World 👋
I'm a German student and since I'm really into programming I spend a lot of time working on my projects.
So far **I learned C, Java, Flutter and the way Linux works**. These are my repositories:

- [GymTrim](https://github.com/naibaf-1/GymTrim): A nice gym application for Android
- [GNOME-Wallpaper-Collection](https://github.com/naibaf-1/GNOME-Wallpaper-Collection): A collection of nice wallpapers

I want to collaborate on some nice projects written in C or Dart, because **I want to show and improve my skills**. At the moment I'm also diving into some nice AI stuff, by contributing to the gluck-bot of the organisation of the Willibald Gluck Gymnasium.
However: I'm still working on my projects listed above, so if you want to help me, feel free to contribute some nice wallpapers to my collection or contribute some to GymTrim. I'm glad if people report issues or if they even contribute, because it shows that my projects are actually useful.
